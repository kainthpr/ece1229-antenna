- resolvingFieldsIncidentOnPlane.tex: tags:

   Fresnel equations, angle of incidence, incident plane, reflection plane, transverse field

- check for places I should be using mathImageFigure.

- ../../figures/ece1229/ChebychevT3FittingDbFig4 plot is messed up.  Fix this log plot to avoid the infinities.

- use subfigure for the handwriting decoder ring.

- style audit for figures (start with caps, end with period).

- use subfig in places with multiple back to back plots.

   4.16-4.19 for example.

- Go through all the problems and find the plots that should be in log scale.

- audit of figures for subfig conversion now done up to: Figure 4.13: Array factor for specified zeros.

- Add to blog mathjax table:
\ifrac
\Real -> \textrm{Re}

- convert julia href reference to nbref.  probably have to add julia macros like the matlab and mathematica ones. (nope)

- do indexing for problem sets.
